public class Student  
{  
public void printDetails();  
{  
//functionality of the method  
}  
pubic void calculatePercentage();  
{  
//functionality of the method  
}  
public void addStudent();  
{  
//functionality of the method  
}  
}  
The above code snippet violates the single responsibility principle. To achieve the goal of the principle, we should implement a separate class that performs a single functionality only.

Student.java

public class Student  
{  
public void addStudent();  
{  
//functionality of the method  
}  
}  
PrintStudentDetails.java

public class PrintStudentDetails  
{  
public void printDetails();  
{  
//functionality of the method  
}  
}  
Percentage.java

public class Percentage  
{  
public void calculatePercentage();  
{  
//functionality of the method  
}  
}
